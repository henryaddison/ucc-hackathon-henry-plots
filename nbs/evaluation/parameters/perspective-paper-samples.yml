    Multi-ensemble member models
    Splits are based on random choice of seasons with equal number of seasons from each time slice

    Compare:

    ### Diffusion models
    * PslS4T4V4 IstanTsqrturrecen no-loc-spec

    ## Diff model

    No loc-spec params (diff models only)

    Inputs from: pressure at sea level and 4 levels of spechum, temp and vorticity

    Target domain and resolution: 64x64 2.2km-4x England and Wales

    Input resolution: 60km/gcmx

    Input transforms are fitted on dataset in use (ie separate GCM and CPM versions) while target transform is fitted only at training on the CPM dataset
